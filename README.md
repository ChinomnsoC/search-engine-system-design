# System Design: Search Engine

## Overview: Scenario-Based DSA Problem (40 minutes)

This project implements a search engine that allows users to search for studies based on keywords. The search engine uses an inverted index to store and retrieve study titles that contain the given keywords.

ðŸ’¡ Scenario:
"You are building a feature for a research platform where users can search for past research studies they participated in. The search system must handle millions of queries efficiently. Each study has a unique study_id, a title, a category, and a description. Users should be able to:"

- Search studies by keyword (title or description)
- Get search results ranked by relevance (i.e., keyword frequency)
- Support autocomplete suggestions when users start typing

Your Task:

- Design a system to store and search studies efficiently.
- Choose the best data structure for fast search and ranking.
- Implement a function search_studies(keyword: str) -> List[str] that returns study titles matching the keyword.
- Optimize for fast lookups, considering scalability.

## Clarifications

I understand that this system is basically like a search engine. I have a couple of questions to clarify some things (how many searches per second do we want to have?, do we want to require the unique fields in search queries?). But I am mindful of the fact that we have 40 minutes, and I know that cannot be enough time to thoroughly complete all these tasks. Is there an aspect you'd like me to focus on first?

## ðŸŽ¯ Prioritizing the Problem

You're absolutely right! We donâ€™t have enough time to build everything, so letâ€™s focus on:

âœ… Step 1: Choosing the Right Data Structure for efficient search

âœ… Step 2: Implementing search_studies(keyword: str) -> List[str]

âœ… Step 3 (if time permits): Adding autocomplete functionality.

Inverted Index is how search engines work. Trie is useful for autocomplete if we have time later.

## The Design

Since this system behaves like a search engine, we need a design that supports fast lookups, filtering, ranking, and scalability. Instead of just storing studies in a traditional database, we should optimize for search efficiency and retrieval speed.

### ðŸŽ¯ Step 1: Understanding the Requirements

ðŸ“Œ Before choosing a data store, letâ€™s break down our core functional needs:

- Keyword-Based Search â†’ Users should be able to search by title, description, or keywords.
- Filtering by Category â†’ Every study belongs to a unique category, so we need efficient category-based filtering.
- Autocomplete â†’ The system should provide real-time suggestions when users start typing.
- Scalability â†’ The search system should support millions of studies and handle high query loads.
- Ranking by Relevance â†’ More relevant results should appear higher in the search results.

ðŸ“Œ Given these requirements, we need to choose the right data store.

### ðŸ’¾ Step 2: Choosing the Right Storage Solution

ðŸ’¡ "We have two main options: a relational database (SQL) or a specialized search engine (NoSQL or full-text search database)."

Given that we need a high-performance search system, we should use Elasticsearch as the primary search engine, supported by Redis for autocomplete. This setup provides fast full-text search, ranking, and real-time suggestions.

### ðŸ›  Step 3: Designing the Data Model

ðŸ’¡ "Now that weâ€™ve picked Elasticsearch, we need to define our document schema."

ðŸ“Œ Study Document Structure (Stored in Elasticsearch)

```json
{
  "study_id": 1,
  "title": "Machine Learning in Psychology",
  "description": "Understanding cognition using ML",
  "category": "Cognitive Science",
  "keywords": ["machine learning", "cognition", "psychology"],
  "timestamp": "2024-02-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

âœ” Why this structure?

The keywords field improves search relevance.
The category field allows efficient filtering.
The timestamp field enables sorting by recency.
ðŸ“Œ Indexing Strategy in Elasticsearch

- Title & description â†’ Full-text search
- Category â†’ Keyword-based filtering
- Timestamp â†’ Sorting by recency
